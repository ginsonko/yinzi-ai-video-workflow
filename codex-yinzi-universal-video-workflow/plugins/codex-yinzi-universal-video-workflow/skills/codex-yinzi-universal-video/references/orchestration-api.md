# Orchestration API
- GET /api/v1/orchestration-onboarding returns a secret-free first-use snapshot: connection, capabilities, active service counts, low-gate guidance, and a budget reminder.

Use the canonical local base URL, normally `http://127.0.0.1:5683`. The bundled MCP server and CLI probe local candidates (`5683,5679,5680,5682`) when `YINZI_WORKFLOW_URL` is not set, prefer a canonical identity, and stop on conflicting identities, so a healthy older API instance is not mistaken for the active orchestration runtime. API responses wrap successful data in `{success:true,data:...}`. The bundled CLI unwraps this shape.

## Write lifecycle

Create with `POST /api/v1/orchestration-sessions`:

```json
{
  "idempotency_key": "codex:<stable-thread-or-task>:<goal-revision>",
  "title": "15 秒商品投流素材",
  "user_goal": "为每个商品制作可测试的 9:16 视频",
  "mode": "collaborate",
  "source_context": {"source_paths": ["D:/商品A"]},
  "budget": {"currency": "CNY", "maximum": 30, "approved": false},
  "actor": "codex"
}
```

Submit a dynamic plan with `PUT /api/v1/orchestration-sessions/:id/plan`. Pass `expected_revision` from the latest readback to reject stale writers:

```json
{
  "expected_revision": 0,
  "confirm": false,
  "actor": "codex",
  "plan": {"summary": "先识别事实和素材，再研究结构、生成缺失镜头并剪辑"},
  "nodes": [
    {
      "node_key": "assets.scan.v1",
      "module_id": "asset.scan",
      "phase": "intake",
      "depends_on": [],
      "executor": "codex",
      "input_refs": [{"type": "local_path", "id": "D:/商品A", "role": "user_authorized_source"}],
      "decision": {"why": "先建立素材真值", "acceptance": ["每个文件有 hash 和用途候选"]}
    }
  ]
}
```

Confirm with `POST .../:id/confirm`, then start with `POST .../:id/start`. Both accept `actor` and confirmation accepts `expected_revision`.

Update a node with `PATCH .../:id/nodes/:nodeIdOrKey`. Include `expected_version` from the latest node readback when multiple writers are possible. Supported states are `pending`, `ready`, `running`, `waiting_confirmation`, `succeeded`, `partial`, `failed`, `skipped`, and `cancelled`.

For terminal failures include a receipt:

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "actor": "codex",
  "error": {"code": "UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT", "message": "上游超时", "retryable": true},
  "receipt": {
    "status": "failed",
    "source": "provider",
    "original_code": "UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT",
    "message": "上游超时",
    "retryable": true,
    "fallback_available": true,
    "next_actions": ["查询原任务", "确认未提交后重试"]
  }
}
```

Retry with `POST .../:id/nodes/:nodeIdOrKey/retry`; a note is optional and has no minimum length. Pause/resume/checkpoint use `POST .../:id/pause`, `/resume`, and `/checkpoint`.

Record a structured Codex fact, decision, progress, research, classification, user message, plan note, or QA result with POST /api/v1/orchestration-sessions/:id/events. The request must include a session-scoped vent_idempotency_key; repeating the same key returns the original event instead of creating a duplicate. Payloads are bounded and reject credential fields, API keys, bearer tokens, and binary content.

## External request reservation

Before a provider request with material cost or duplicate-side-effect risk, atomically reserve the request on its orchestration node:

`POST /api/v1/orchestration-sessions/:id/nodes/:nodeIdOrKey/external-request`

```json
{
  "actor": "codex",
  "request_hash": "sha256-of-locked-request-and-idempotency-key",
  "message": "正在提交一次受预算保护的图片生成请求",
  "decision": {
    "paid": true,
    "idempotency_key": "stable-logical-action-key",
    "provider": "saved-provider-name",
    "model": "locked-model-name",
    "config_id": 2,
    "price_snapshot": {"unit_price_usd": 0.07, "source_version": "catalog-version"}
  }
}
```

`reserved:true` grants one submission attempt. The same hash later returns `reserved:false` and `reconciliation_required:true`; query the existing generation/task instead of submitting again. A different hash conflicts and must not overwrite an in-flight, uncertain, accepted, or settled request.

## Guarded image generation

Use MCP `generate_image_once` for a newly authorized image request. It requires:

- `session_id` and a dedicated `node_key`;
- stable `idempotency_key` and `confirmed_paid_action:true`;
- locked `image_config_id`, `provider`, `model`, and `group_name`;
- the final prompt and optional reference images;
- `max_unit_price_usd` from the user's approved exposure.

The tool first proves that the public local configuration matches the locked service type, provider, and model, is active, and has a saved credential. It then reads the local live price table before reservation. When the configuration contains a verifiable group binding, that exact group price is used. When it does not, the tool uses the highest current catalog price for the provider/model and labels the estimate `unverified_config_group_worst_case`; the caller cannot pick a cheap group name to understate exposure. Missing or ambiguous price, a higher current price, missing confirmation, configuration mismatch, or a request-hash conflict stops before `/api/v1/images`. A successful create response records both the local image-generation ID and asynchronous task ID. The returned cost is a live-catalog estimate until an actual provider billing receipt proves settlement.

After submission, use MCP `reconcile_image` with the same session and node. It reads `/api/v1/images/:id` and `/api/v1/tasks/:taskId`, then records one of:

- `pending`: the same task still runs;
- `succeeded`: an actual readable output is attached and the node completes;
- `failed`: the provider/local error is retained and billing remains unknown unless separately evidenced;
- `unresolved`: no generation/task identifier proves acceptance, so the node stays uncertain and no new request is sent.

Transport timeout after reservation is never proof of failure and never authorizes a resend.

## Guarded video generation

Use MCP `generate_video_once` for a newly authorized paid video request. It requires a dedicated session/node, stable idempotency key, `confirmed_paid_action:true`, locked `video_config_id`/provider/model/group, final prompt and reference manifest, a capability-valid duration and resolution, and `max_cost_cny` covering no more than the user's approved exposure.

Before reserving the external request hash, the tool asks the local backend to discover the saved Key's live model catalog with `persist_snapshot:false`. The exact requested model or a proven exact capability alias must be present as a Key-verified video offer; public pricing alone is never permission to spend. Discovery failure, a text-only Key, a public-only offer, or a backend that cannot prove the probe was non-persisting stops with zero reservation and zero `/videos` submission. This automatic-paid safety check does not change the application's advisory/manual unknown-model behavior.

Before atomic reservation, the tool reads the public saved configuration, its model-capability state, and the current Yinzi CNY catalog. The request model must remain present in the saved configuration. A price-directory alias is accepted only when the current contracts prove the same family, resolution, provider protocol, fixed duration, and enumerated durations; a similar-looking name is never enough. If the saved configuration has no verifiable group binding, the tool uses the highest current price among all proven aliases, so a caller-supplied cheap group cannot understate exposure. Unknown contract, unsupported duration/reference count, price drift, currency/billing ambiguity, or budget excess stops before `/api/v1/videos`.

A single `reserved:true` permits exactly one local `POST /api/v1/videos`. The response records the local generation ID, local asynchronous task ID, provider task ID when available, request hash, configuration ID, capability snapshot, price source/version, and estimated CNY exposure. A local generation record is not proof that the provider accepted it. Transport or response ambiguity remains `uncertain`; call `reconcile_video`, never `generate_video_once` as a resend mechanism.

`reconcile_video` reads the same generation/task or recovers the generation by the persisted request hash. It reports:

- `unresolved`: no existing generation/task can yet be proved; keep the reservation and do not resend;
- `pending`: the original task remains submitted, accepted, generating, or downloading;
- `provider_completed_downloading`: upstream generation completed but no readable local media exists yet;
- `succeeded`: generation completed, local download completed, and non-zero local video bytes were read;
- `failed`: generation failed; billing stays unknown unless an actual provider receipt proves it;
- `download_failed`: upstream generation completed but the local download failed.

Pass `retry_download:true` only for `download_failed`. It calls the existing local download-recovery route and never creates another video. A catalog estimate is not a charge, refund, or balance receipt.

## CLI

Run from the skill directory (Codex should resolve the bundled script relative to `SKILL.md`):

```powershell
node scripts/orchestration-cli.mjs health
node scripts/orchestration-cli.mjs sessions
node scripts/orchestration-cli.mjs get <session-id>
node scripts/orchestration-cli.mjs create --input .\request.json
node scripts/orchestration-cli.mjs plan <session-id> --input .\plan.json
node scripts/orchestration-cli.mjs node <session-id> <node-key> --input .\node-update.json
node scripts/orchestration-cli.mjs retry <session-id> <node-key> --input .\retry.json
```

Set `YINZI_WORKFLOW_URL` when the local service uses another URL or when you want to pin a specific instance. You may override discovery candidates with `YINZI_WORKFLOW_CANDIDATE_URLS` or `YINZI_WORKFLOW_CANDIDATE_PORTS`. The CLI rejects likely credential fields or raw `sk-...` values in write payloads.

On `409 VERSION_CONFLICT` or `PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT`, do not force the write. Read the latest bundle, reconcile the user's current intent, and submit a new revision.
